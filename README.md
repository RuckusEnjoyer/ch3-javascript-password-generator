# ch3-javascript-password-generator

## Description
I created this webpage off of a base given by my bootcamp in order to better understand algorithms and Math in javascript. When creating this project, I did research on Math.floor, Math.ceiling, Math.round, Math.random, Prompts, Alerts, and Confirms. 

This website made me re-learn that Javascript is read top to bottom. 

I would like to mention that I only created the javascript in this application.
## Usage/Screenshot
To generate a secure and random password, click the Generate Password Button. You will get a pop up that asks how many characters you would like your password to be, then if you would like lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, or special characters. If you don't want one of these options, hit cancel. At the end, your new password will spawn.
